# WIP

This document is dynamically generated from the contents of `data.yml` with the help of Ruby and Liquid.
Checkout the contents of the generator folder to see how.

You will need to run `gem install liquid` if you don't already have it installed.

To generate the README locally, run:

```sh
awesome_list_generator generate README.md --data data.yml --template .github/config/template.liquid
```
